# CRYPTOGLYPH
>Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to make the number on the right match the number on the left.

>This you must do by selecting from the four glyphs, each one of which has a fixed, randomly assigned number which is unknown to you until you click it.

>If your sequence of numbers equals the game number, you win the round. If your number exceeds the game's number, you lose that round.

>Whether you win or lose, all new numbers will then be chosen, and the game will begin anew.
